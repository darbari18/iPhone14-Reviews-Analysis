Gifting the iPhone 14 to my wife on her birthday was a fantastic decision. She absolutely loves it! The camera upgrades have brought so much joy to her daily life. She can't stop raving about the picture quality and how it helps her capture our family moments beautifully. The elegant design also resonates with her taste. It's not just a phone; it's become an integral part of her daily routine and her favorite gift ever. Seeing her happy with it makes it a great choice for me.,5.0,0.49000000000000005,Positive,1

"After using android for 10 years, and having used 12+256 gb android phone in last 2 years, iPhone 14 lacks in performance in every aspect. Camera- normal. Battery backup- okay, battery charging- pathetic. Those who say iPhone does not hang is a person with slow mind. Most of the apps are buggy. Very slow and loading takes a long time. iPhone offers few gimmicks but not worthy. Do not fall in trap. Most iPhone users know, iPhone is just like a heavy crown made of rusty iron on your head.

Display : 60hz but impressive,

Charging: Charging speed is quite good with 20w charger but at such price point it could be better.

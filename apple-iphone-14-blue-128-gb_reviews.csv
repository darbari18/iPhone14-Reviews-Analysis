"Best smart phone under this price range compare to other phones in 2023 if you see overall build quality, performance and Camera with autofocus and video action mode are awesome
50% extra RAM compared to iPhone 13 and other more features. Best time to upgrade to iPhone 14 . I am so happy
See Low light photos are amazing..",5

"Damn such a great phone. Camera is really good, battery lasts long enough, super smooth even though its just 60 hz XDR display. Videos with action mode on are insanely stable and crisp.The night mode can take some really good shots jn low light conditions .The whole apple environment itself is so seamless. I shifted from android to iPhone and it barely took any time since I had iPad and a mac already. With a just a few clicks the phone was ready to go.",5

"I wanted to buy yellow colour but that was not delivering on my pin code so went for this colour.

After receiving this, I have no regression.

Love this.

iPhone heats a lot because of its built. Its frame is steel and the back is glass but it has great things when it gets hot, it restricts some features to cool it down.

The camera is good, sometimes it misses focus.

Performance is the best part of it.",5

"Very good purchase.i bought it for my wife as a Padwa gift.
but just my views on purchasing this expensive phone- if you are using Iphone very lower version go for it but if you are already in iphone 13 or 11 do not spend money,its not worth.no much change.
but if you have lots of money then go for it.
wife was using iphone 7 hence i purchased this latest one.

"The iPhone 14 is a solid choice for those looking for a high-quality smartphone experience. The camera is top-notch, the performance is smooth, and the design is sleek and modern. However, there are a few drawbacks to consider when comparing it to Android phones.

One of the biggest cons of the iPhone 14 is its lack of customization options. Apple has a strict policy on what apps and features can be used on their devices, which can be frustrating for users who want more control over their pho...

Flipkart sold a cosmetically defective product and never took ownership and replaced it. Terrible customer support and issue resolution from the team. Please never buy high value goods from Flipkart. Don't waste your money. Buy directly from Apple; their customer support is excellent.,1

Gifting the iPhone 14 to my wife on her birthday was a fantastic decision. She absolutely loves it! The camera upgrades have brought so much joy to her daily life. She can't stop raving about the picture quality and how it helps her capture our family moments beautifully. The elegant design also resonates with her taste. It's not just a phone; it's become an integral part of her daily routine and her favorite gift ever. Seeing her happy with it makes it a great choice for me.,5

"After using android for 10 years, and having used 12+256 gb android phone in last 2 years, iPhone 14 lacks in performance in every aspect. Camera- normal. Battery backup- okay, battery charging- pathetic. Those who say iPhone does not hang is a person with slow mind. Most of the apps are buggy. Very slow and loading takes a long time. iPhone offers few gimmicks but not worthy. Do not fall in trap. Most iPhone users know, iPhone is just like a heavy crown made of rusty iron on your head.

Camera: if lighting condition is good then it can click very good photos but incase of poor lighting not good experience at such price point.

Charging: Charging speed is quite good with 20w charger but at such price point it could be better.

I recommend you buy iphone 14 instead of iphone 13 for various reasons:
Additional 2 GB RAM
Larger 5G antenna which helps with faster 5G speed
Improved cameras

However, I've noticed that the iPhone's battery is weaker, and the display always has a yellowish shade, even with True Tone disabled. I can overlook that, but the main drawback is the camera. While the video quality is great in this price range, the photos are disappointing compared to mid-range Android phones, which have better cameras. The photos lack sharpness and color saturation. Yes, you can edit them, but it'...

"True Depth camera update
Satellite communications
Crash detection
Long battery life excellent smartphone
Sports a familiar design, notch and all. While it still rocks an A15 Bionic processor, it's at least the five-core GPU variant from the iPhone 13 Pro and Pro Max for a marginal upgrade. Satellite-to-cellular support, crash detection, and an improved True Depth camera system make the iPhone 14 a compelling purchase.",2

"I purchased iphone during the Big Billion Days sale, and I was pleasantly surprised by the exceptional quality of the packaging. Moreover, I received the phone just two days after placing the order, which is a testament to the outstanding service provided by Flipkart.

Now, let's not dwell on the incredible qualities of the iPhone 14, as we all know how exceptional it is. What I want to highlight is the outstanding service provided by Flipkart. They managed to get me the iPhone 14 for only a ...

Pros- you get a perfect fine display,camera takes some Excellent shots in both day n night,battery is pretty good lasts almost 1 and half days.

Cons- you will miss some of the features u were enjoying on Android..no AppLock,no fingerprint sensor,lags in smooth refresh

Ps- it's a review after using apple for 15 days.",5

"First and foremost, the Product Red variant is absolutely gorgeous. The vibrant red colour not only makes a bold statement but also supports a noble cause, as a portion of the proceeds goes to the Global Fund to fight AIDS. Sleek and stunning design. iPhone 14 also exhibits remarkable speed and responsiveness, thanks to its powerful A16 Bionic chip. Whether I'm multitasking or playing graphics-intensive games, the phone handles everything effortlessly.

The camera performance is, as expected...

Upgraded from iPhone 11 and OMG!!! The performance feels amazing and the camera quality is top notch ❤️❤️❤️,5
"Camera and Display are good. Battery lasts for one day for medium usage. Overall Apple is good in hardware. Moving from Android hence taking time to get used to iOS. Some features in Android are better like swipe on side to move back, notifications swipe down from anywhere in the screen instead in iOS have to go all the way to top and swipe down to pull notifications. For now Android user experience is better. Don't know if it will change after getting used to iOS.",5

"The experience has been really good. The weight of the phone is significantly lighter than iPhone 11. The OLED screen is amazing with higher resolution providing more content on the screen. And this has 5g. The phone is snappier than my previous phone. But coming from an iPhone you really wont notice much difference since the experience is the same. After the restore everything looks and feels the same, thats really good",5
